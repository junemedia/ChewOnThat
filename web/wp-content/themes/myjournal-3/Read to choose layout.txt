MyJournal Hypereal comes with several layouts allowing you to choose where
you want your sidebars and content column to appear and the number of columns
you want.

The default one is the 3Columns with 2 right sidebars and a left content column.

To choose another layout :
1) Open the style.css found in the myjournal_hypereal theme's folder
2) Under the theme's information section at the topmost area, you'll see the following section:

/* Choose your layout here, see Read to choose layout.txt found in theme's folder */
@import url('layouts/3cright.css'); 

3) Replace 3cright.css with the following according to the layout you want:
3.1	3cleft.css	- for a 3Columns layout with left sidebars and a right content column.
3.2	3cboth.css	- for a 3Columns layout with sidebar on sides of a center content column.
3.3	2cright.css	- for a 2Columns layout with sidebar on the right.
3.4	2cleft.css	- for a 2Columns layout with sidebar on the left.

All layouts' stylesheets are found in the layouts folder under myJournal Hypereal theme's folder.

Additional layouts will get added so do subscribe to my feeds to receive info about future
